We present first principles calculations of the linewidths of low energy quasiparticles in n doped graphene arising from both the electron electron and the electron phonon interactions The contribution to the electron linewidth arising from the electron electron interactions vary significantly with wavevector at fixed energy in contrast the electron phonon contribution is virtually wavevector independent These two contributions are comparable in magnitude at a binding energy of ~0 2 eV corresponding to the optical phonon energy The calculated linewidths with both electron electron and electron phonon interactions included explain to a large extent the linewidths seen in recent photoemission experiments We present first principles calculations of the linewidths of low energy quasiparticles in n doped graphene arising from both the electron electron and the electron phonon interactions The contribution to the electron linewidth arising from the electron electron interactions vary significantly with wavevector at fixed energy in contrast the electron phonon contribution is virtually wavevector independent These two contributions are comparable in magnitude at a binding energy of ~0 2 eV corresponding to the optical phonon energy The calculated linewidths with both electron electron and electron phonon interactions included explain to a large extent the linewidths seen in recent photoemission experiments We present first principles calculations of the linewidths of low energy quasiparticles in n doped graphene arising from both the electron electron and the electron phonon interactions The contribution to the electron linewidth arising from the electron electron interactions vary significantly with wavevector at fixed energy in contrast the electron phonon contribution is virtually wavevector independent These two contributions are comparable in magnitude at a binding energy of ~0 2 eV corresponding to the optical phonon energy The calculated linewidths with both electron electron and electron phonon interactions included explain to a large extent the linewidths seen in recent photoemission experiments We present first principles calculations of the linewidths of low energy quasiparticles in n doped graphene arising from both the electron electron and the electron phonon interactions The contribution to the electron linewidth arising from the electron electron interactions vary significantly with wavevector at fixed energy in contrast the electron phonon contribution is virtually wavevector independent These two contributions are comparable in magnitude at a binding energy of ~0 2 eV corresponding to the optical phonon energy The calculated linewidths with both electron electron and electron phonon interactions included explain to a large extent the linewidths seen in recent photoemission experiments
